              Campus Leaders at Code For Cause are people with an entrepreneurial mindset who want to add value to the community by spreading awareness about the cause and gather like-minded people to work towards it. Above all, Campus Leaders lead-by-example and influence people by their contribution to the community.

              <li>
                An Initiative taker: A Leader should always have a way of talking people out of problems and leading them to do the same for others
              </li>
              <li>
                A Community Builder: ​A true leader should identify the resources available within the community, and use them to help build a better & more helpful one.
              </li>
              <li>
                A Resource Seeker:​ Most sought out value for a Leader - a giving personality and an effort maker, making anything possible with the given resources.
